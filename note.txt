digital signature => 
    1. Electronic, encrypted stamp of authentication on electronic or digital information like email messages, macros and electronic documents.                  
    2. Digital signature uses PKI or asymmetric encryption. 
    3. Digital signature is an unique, numerical value of encrypted data used to prove the owner ship or copy right of the data.
    4. To create a digital signature, a one-way hash of the electronic data is encrypted or signed using a private key. 
    5. To verify the digital signature, the hash value is using a public key. If the hash matches a second computed hash of the same data, it proves that the data hasn't changed since it was signed.


pieces of information included in a digital signature => 
    1. Serial Number
    2. Subject or Signer or Organization Name
    3. Issuer
    4. Signature Algorithm
    5. Date or Validity
    6. Key usage


why the Organization could be trusted => 
    1. because the Organization was digitally signed
    2. because it comes from a trusted source


2 types of network intrusion detection systems (NIDS) => 
    1. signature based
    2. anomaly based


what a vulnerability assessment is and explain its importance for Red Stack’s customers in the scenario => 
    1. vulnerability assessment is the process of identifying, quantifying and prioritizing or ranking the vulnerabilities of the network or system
    2. customers will need the vulnerability assessment to detect the systems that may have been compromised with the Titan malware


The Titan software source code is stored on a private GitHub repository and can be accessed with the username ‘admin’ and password ‘redstack123’ by all staff members at Red Stack Ltd.

    Explain the weaknesses of using this password for authentication => 
        1. password is easy to crack with dictionary attack
        2. password is weak and easy to guess

    5 methods that can be used to improve password security and access control on the private GitHub repository => 
        1. use a complex password
        2. use biometrics
        3. use multi-factor authentication
        4. regularly changing the password 
        5. access control mechanism to allow the only authorized user can access to the repository


5 methods to prevent computers from unauthorized access to the data they hold => 
    1. backup data
    2. have strong access control mechanisms
    3. password protect documents and files
    4. encrypt files
    5. encrypt disks


2 methods that can be used to secure email systems => 
    1. sign the email message to ensure integrity and confirm the identity of the sender
    2. encrypt email body increase confidentiality
    3. encrypt the communication between mail servers to increase the confidentiality of both header and body of the email message


what a Demilitarized Zone(DMZ) is and how it can be useful => 

    1. DMZ is an internal network but separated from other internal network by a firewall
    2. it can be useful to protect public-facing Email servers with firewalls
